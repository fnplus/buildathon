# Buildathon

##### *Buildathon* is an international programming lab format open to any language and developed for continuous improvement. We help others practice programming, software development and communication skills by making coding laboratories open to any programming language where cooperation is valued over competition, doing and sharing are valued over teaching, and where competing solutions come with discussing and understanding tradeoffs.

## Buildathon in a nutshell

A canonical **Buildathon** is organized by one or more **FnPlus** trainers.

For each challenge, the attendees **pair off** and each pair **chooses the programming language to solve the challenge**. The trainer reads the problem and shows a few examples. Then **people start working** on the same challenge at the same time. In the meantime, the trainer peeks at what pairs are doing and gives hints if someone gets stuck.

When the **time** for a challenge **is over**, the trainer opens a **retrospective** and asks some people to explain their solutions. The target of the **discussion** is to understand **tradeoffs**, **pros** and **cons** of each. In this phase, the trainer may ask people **additional questions** and may **change constraints** of the problem. This way people have to discuss about the **impact** of these new requirements. Moreover, the trainer may show alternative solutions.

## Why attending Buildathon?

**Builathon** is a recurring event developed for people to:

- improve problem analysis and solving skills

- improve fluency with the standard library and the idioms of known programming languages

- hands-on a real project

- learn new algorithms, data structures and coding patterns

- practice unknown programming languages and paradigms

In addition, **Buildathon** has been designed with additional benefits, since **people meet** and **work together**:

- **working with others**, instead of competing

- **discussing with others**, focusing on a specific challenge

- **building relationships**

Last but not least, **Buildathon** may help people prepare for **programming interviews**. Indeed, many challenges are taken from real "tech giants" programming interviews.

- improve problem analysis and algorithm design skills

- learn new concepts, algorithms, data structures and coding patterns

- practice known languages and experiment new languages

- improve collaboration and communication skills

- prepare for coding interviews

## Buildathon Philosophy

Buildathon Philosophy is based on the following concepts:

#### Freedom: Language and Paradigm Independence

Buildathon is not tied to any paradigm nor programming language since **Buildathon** exploits everything to achieve its targets and it is not limited by anything. For this reason, **Buildathon is free.**

#### Any problem has value: Finding alternative solutions and patterns means improving and learning

For each problem, **Buildathon** encourages to look for, study and experiment with alternative solutions, patterns and variations on the problem. This way, the brain is pushed to break the mold, growing up and learning new concepts, techniques and patterns. New solutions come with tradeoffs, pros and cons that must be identified and understood. After all, a key aspect of software development concerns balancing the best tradeoffs for a particular domain. **Buildathon establishes its training philosophy not only in facing and solving problems but also developing and comparing alternative solutions**. **Buildathon** problems are self-contained and they are naturally open to variations and change of requirements.

In addition, **Any problem has value** is a principle that **Buildathon** exploits to maximize the value of *easy* challenges. For example, calculating the sum of the elements of an array is a trivial task. We just loop over the elements and sum them to an accumulator. Actually we can learn a pattern from this exercise. What if instead of sum we want product of the elements? The **structure** of the solution is the same but the **operation** (multiplication). Is there a pattern behind the scenes? It is called **reduce** (or **fold**). Some of us learnt something new. How to code such a pattern with our pet languages? Something more to learn. Is there any *price* coming from such a pattern? If we use this pattern into production, does our colleagues know how to change and debug this code? We started from a trivial task and we are actually going very far with interesting questions...

#### Only you can help yourself: The trainer can just show your vulnerability, sometimes

**Buildathon is not a course but it is arranged by one or more trainers**. A trainer does not hold nor dispense any truth, rather she is just someone who will show "vulnerability" of attendees and will incite them to investigate concepts and techniques to improve. For example, a trainer might show an alternative approach to solve a problem or might propose a variation on the problem to quiz people on the possible impact.

#### Collaboration over competition: Pair Programming as a professional mean to improve soft-skills

**Buildathon is not a contest**. Using pair programming, **Buildathon** creates an environment conducive to active learning and collaboration, helps to lower gymmers frustration with too challenging problems. Pair programming encourages gymmers to interact with peers and share information, thereby creating a more communal and supportive environment. The collaboration inherent in pair programming exposes and reinforces gymmers to the collaboration, teamwork, and communication skills required in industry.

Collaboration and sharing are key principles of **Buildathon**: people are encouraged to share their ideas and solutions during the retrospective. **Sharing is communication** and **Buildathon** creates an friendly environment to train communication skills. **Buildathon** usually hosts at most 25/30 people, making easier even for introvert people to put themself on the line.
